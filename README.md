# Super-Store-Project
I Did one of the Most Important Projects for Super Store, an online multinational platform.
I used Excel to completely clean the data, ask the most important questions, and answer them through EDA As Report.
I used Python for Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and EDA Conclusion. To help the organization make decisions on accurate data.
I created an interactive Excel dashboard through which I was able to reach decisions and advice that increase profit by more than 15% and reduce costs significantly.
